# schema

Chocolate schema library. Typescript definitions of the Schemas defined [here](https://github.com/chocolatenetwork/Chocolate-Spec) as well as a build step that generates json schema from the types.

## Build

Run `nx build schema` to build the schema.

> Schema keys should be sorted after building for readability. You can sort the schema by the recommended extension for sorting in vscode. A PR with a lightweight `JSON.stringify` alternative with sorting would also be appreciated.
